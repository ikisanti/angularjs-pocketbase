#### Clients:
Fields: name, email, phone, address, created_at
Orders (optional for future expansion):
Fields: client_id, burrito_type, quantity, total_price, order_date
2. Set Up the AngularJS Frontend
Install Dependencies: You donâ€™t need additional packages for this simple setup, but ensure AngularJS is loaded via CDN in index.html.

pocketbaseService.js: Contains methods for interacting with the PocketBase API.
clienteController.js: Manages data operations and binds data to the views.
Create Views:

- add-client.html: Form to input new client details.
list-clients.html: Displays a list of clients retrieved from the backend.

3. Running the Application
